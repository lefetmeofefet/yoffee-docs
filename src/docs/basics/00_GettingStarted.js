# What is Yoffee.js?
Yoffee.js is reactive, unopinionated, lightweight UI library. 

With yoffee you can create web components, 
which are brand new html tags. These web components can be used anywhere, with zero boilerplate.

Yoffee is unopinionated - it doesn't force a special syntax. You just write regular HTML, and the reactive parts of the
UI will be updated automatically when they should!
